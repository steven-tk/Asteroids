# Asteroids Project

Future feature ideas:

- add 2 player mode (arrow + right shift?)
- add sprite graphics (license? make myself?)
  - sprite atlas to draw randomly from? just scale one?
- add score tracking (per player)
- add score board (post game entry?)
- add pause/menu (esc?)
- add bounce for asteroids and player-on-player (non damage-collision)
- add background
- add acceleration (player) (also missile if added as weapon)
- add life (max 3?) / respawn mechanic
- add drops (+life, fire rate, ..?)
- add explosion effect???
- add screen wrap for player
- add invulnerable frames & dmg to asteroid for ship on asteroid collision)
- triangular hitbox for player
- other power ups (e.g. laser weapon for x seconds, invul-shield, …) sprites/on-screen effects for this?
- add an ingame menu
- collectable upgrades?
- sound/music?

Control via command flags (e.g. -2p) (or menu?)
