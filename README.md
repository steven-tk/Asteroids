# Asteroids Project

Future feature ideas:



Prio 1:

- add 2 player mode (arrow + right shift?)
  - use subclass and overwrite control function
  - Control via command flags (e.g. -2p) (or menu?)
- add score tracking (per player)
- add screen wrap for player & shots
- add bounce for asteroids and player-on-player (non damage-collision)
- offset asteroid split more naturally? (do collision first)



Menu/screens:

- game over screen
- add score board (post game entry?)
- add an ingame menu 
- add pause/menu (esc?)


Graphics:

- add background
- add asteroid sprite graphics (license? make myself?)
  - random rotation speed/direction 
  - sprite atlas to draw randomly from? just scale one?
- add explosion effect???



Player features:

- add acceleration (player) (also missile if added as weapon)
- add life (max 3?) / respawn mechanic
- add drops (+life, fire rate, ..?)
- add invulnerable frames & dmg to asteroid for ship on asteroid collision)
- triangular hitbox for player
- other power ups (e.g. laser weapon for x seconds, invul-shield, …) sprites/on-screen effects for this?
- collectable upgrades?
- sound/music?
